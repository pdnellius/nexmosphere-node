# Nexmosphere node.js Serial Streaming

This project is a simple node script for logging values coming through Nexmosphere's RS-232 to USB interface. It uses the node `serialport` package to log data stream values to the console.  

Simply a good starting place for implementing Nexmosphere with node.
